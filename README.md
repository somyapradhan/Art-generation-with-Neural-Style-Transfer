# Art-generation-with-Neural-Style-Transfer

Overview
This project leverages the power of neural networks to generate stunning art by blending the content of one image with the style of another. Using advanced deep learning techniques, this implementation captures the artistic essence of a style image and applies it to a content image, creating a unique piece of art.

Features
Content and Style Image Input: Users can upload their own content and style images to create customized artwork.
Neural Style Transfer: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network to perform style transfer.

Model
The VGG19 model is a deep convolutional neural network that is widely used for image recognition and style transfer tasks. Developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford, this model consists of 19 layers, including 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. VGG19 is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, making it a popular choice for various computer vision applications. Its architecture emphasizes depth through very small (3x3) convolution filters, which allows it to learn intricate patterns and features from images.
